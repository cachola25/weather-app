# Baseline Design
### The initial design of the weather app was taken from:
https://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/weather-app-html-css-js-90xvr?file=%2Findex.js%3A2%2C1-65%2C1
### Justification for using an Online Template
As programmers, we often use solutions that are already made by other
people to enhance our producitivity whether it's using AI to check our
code or using a package that contains tools that we can use to 
solve our problems. The code from the website doesn't contain
all the functionality required by the assessment, but it does 
give me a better starting point to create my productâ€”so, this is why
I am electing to use it.
